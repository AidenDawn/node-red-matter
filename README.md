# Node-RED Matter Plugin

The Node-RED Matter plugin is an open-source project that enables the generation of Matter devices within Node-RED.
Matter devices created using this plugin can be seamlessly integrated into popular smart home controllers such as
Apple Home, Google Home, and Alexa. Additionally, you can control and retrieve data from these devices directly within Node-RED.

The project is heavily based on [matter.js](https://github.com/project-chip/matter.js), the official JavaScript Matter SDK.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Matter Device Generation**: Generate Matter devices within Node-RED for easy integration with various smart home controllers.
- **Controller Compatibility**: Compatible with popular smart home controllers such as Apple Home, Google Home, and Alexa.
- **Bi-Directional Communication**: Control and read data from Matter devices directly within Node-RED.
- **Flexibility**: Customize and configure the behavior of Matter devices based on your specific requirements.
- **Seamless Integration**: Connect Matter devices to existing Node-RED flows effortlessly.

## ‚õî Limitations

Currently, the Node-RED Matter plugin has the following limitations:

- The plugin only supports the OnOffLightDevice (light) and OnOffPluginUnitDevice (outlet) device types,
  more device types will be added in the future.

## üíæ Backup

The generated Matter device configurations are currently stored in `~/.node-red/node-red-matter/matter-devices`, or under wherever your Node-RED
user directory is located.

Each device is stored in a sub-folder named after the configuration node ID, if you ever need to recreate a Matter configuration node but don't want to
lose your existing virtual Matter device, you can simply rename the folder with the new configuration node ID and it will automatically pick it up.
